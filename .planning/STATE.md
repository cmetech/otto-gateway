# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-23)

**Core value:** All three API surfaces (OpenAI for Pi SDK, Ollama for LangFlow, Anthropic for loop24-client/GSD Pi) serve their respective clients without those clients knowing kiro-cli exists, with one place to enforce policy.
**Current focus:** Phase 6 — tool call path

## Current Position

Phase: 6
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to execute
Next: /gsd-discuss-phase 1.1 → /gsd-plan-phase 1.1 → /gsd-execute-phase 1.1 → /gsd-plan-phase 2
Last activity: 2026-05-26 -- Phase 06 planning complete

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 27
- Average duration: n/a
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 5 | - | - |
| 01.1 | 5 | - | - |
| 02 | 6 | - | - |
| 03.1 | 6 | - | - |
| 05 | 5 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: n/a (no plans executed yet)
- Trend: n/a

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 3.1 inserted after Phase 3: Anthropic Surface — adapter/anthropic for Messages API at /v1/messages with SSE streaming day-one (loop24-client / GSD Pi via ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL). Promotes SURF-V2-01 to v1; adds ANTH-01..07 + SURF-08. (URGENT)
- Phase 1.1 inserted after Phase 1: ACP Wire Alignment — fix 10 wire-shape defects discovered during Phase 2 discuss; add real-kiro session/prompt round-trip integration test as Phase 2 unblock gate (URGENT)
- Phase 8 edited: edited fields: goal, requirements (+PLUG-06), success_criteria (+SC6 PIIRedactionHook)
- Phase 8 edited: edited fields: requirements (+OBSV-04), success_criteria (+SC7 GET /health/hooks view-only)

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Pre-Phase 1: Go over Rust (cross-compile triviality, first systems project for author)
- Pre-Phase 1: Dual API surface (OpenAI + Ollama) on one binary, one canonical engine
- Pre-Phase 1: Adapter-over-canonical layout — `internal/adapter/{ollama,openai}` ↔ `internal/canonical` ↔ `internal/engine`
- Pre-Phase 1: stdlib `net/http` + `chi` (reject `fasthttp`)
- Pre-Phase 1: Trust-gate suite required from day one (Phase 1 establishes lint/test/security baseline)
- Pre-Phase 7: Out-of-process embeddings sidecar provisional (avoids cgo; revisit in plan-phase 7)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Pi SDK env var / config key for setting OpenAI base URL needs verification before Phase 3 starts (per PROJECT.md "Context — Clients" — open verification item).
